The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or non-resident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/ae971a45d16cba705b99d486ed94b39800c23781","indicator":"17.1.1","target_id":"17.1","sdg_goal":"17","indicator_sort_order":"17-01-01"},"17-2-1":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors\u2019 gross national income (GNI)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors\u2019 gross national income (GNI)","indicator_number":"17.2.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 17.2: Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries;

This transaction cost should be intended as <strong>&#x201C;</strong><strong>Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent&#x201D;.</strong> This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/ae971a45d16cba705b99d486ed94b39800c23781","indicator":"10.c.1","target_id":"10.c","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-0c-01"},"11-b-2":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","indicator_number":"11.b.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"11.b.2","target_id":"11.b","sdg_goal":"11","indicator_sort_order":"11-0b-02"},"1-3-1":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable","indicator_number":"1.3.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"1.3.1","target_id":"1.3","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-03-01"},"3-5-1":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders","indicator_number":"3.5.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"3.5.1","target_id":"3.5","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-05-01"},"16-7-1":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportions of positions in national and local institutions, including (a) the legislatures;

Budgetary central government, described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government&#x2019;s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 2.42). including references to standards and classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number of people, etc.).</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-28: see
