It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or non-resident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/ae971a45d16cba705b99d486ed94b39800c23781","indicator":"17.1.1","target_id":"17.1","sdg_goal":"17","indicator_sort_order":"17-01-01"}
