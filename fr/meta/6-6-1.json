The indicator is multifaceted capturing data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes. The indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different freshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as generating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.</p>","DATA_COMP":"   ","REC_USE_LIM":"   ","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 6.6: By 2030 protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 6.6.1: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time</p>","un_designated_tier":"Niveau I","un_custodian_agency":"UN Environment (UNEP), Ramsar","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=6&Target=6.6","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-17","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-17: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/c4b34509582f74220c9fdeb63c5c66316a25997e","indicator":"6.6.1","target_id":"6.6","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-06-01"}
