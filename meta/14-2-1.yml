SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources

SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 14.1: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution
  of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris
  and nutrient pollution</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 14.2.1: Number of countries using ecosystem-based approaches
  to managing marine areas</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &#x2018;Integrated Coastal
  Zone Management (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with
  Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to assess
  ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure existing
  plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for this indicator
  will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas Programme. </p>
