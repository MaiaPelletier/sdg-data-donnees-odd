SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 5.c.1: Percentage of countries with systems to track
  and make public allocations for gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF:
- <p>The indicator seeks to measure government efforts to track budget allocations
  for gender equality throughout the public finance management cycle and to make these
  publicly available. This is an indicator of characteristics of the fiscal system.
  It is not an indicator of quantity or quality of finance allocated for gender equality
  and women&#x2019;s empowerment (GEWE). The indicator measures three criteria. The
  first focuses on the intent of a government to address GEWE by identifying if it
  has programs/policies and resource allocations to foster GEWE. The second assesses
  if a government has planning and budget tools to track resources for GEWE throughout
  the public financial management cycle. The third focuses on transparency by identifying
  if a government has provisions to make allocations for GEWE publicly available.</p>
