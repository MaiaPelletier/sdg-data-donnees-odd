  a proportion of available freshwater resources</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<p>The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion
  of available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn
  by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into
  account environmental flow requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards,
  include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry;
  and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity.</p>'
