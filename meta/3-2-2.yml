SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children
  under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to
  at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as
  low as 25 per 1,000 live births</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 3.2.2: Neonatal mortality rate</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The neonatal mortality rate is the probability that a child born
  in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life
  if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live
  births.</p>
