SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and
  sanitation for all</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 6.6: By 2030 protect and restore water-related ecosystems,
  including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 6.6.1: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems
  over time</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>Indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related
  ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing
  data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the
  indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes.
  The indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different
  freshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available
  on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as
  generating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water
  bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are
  aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative
  areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin
  boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not
  yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated
  into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided
  from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.</p>
