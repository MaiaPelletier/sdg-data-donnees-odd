SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target: 12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail
  and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including
  post-harvest losses</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator: 12.3.1 (a) Food loss index and (b) food waste index</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The indicator aims to measure the total amount of food that is wasted
  in tonnes. It complements SDG 12.3.1(a) on Food Loss (which is under the custodianship
  of FAO). Both indicators look to divide the food value chain and measure the efficiency
  of the food system. </p>
