SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator: 6.3.2 Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient
  water quality</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the
  country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural,
  untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of
  natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The
  indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the
  analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed
  by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality
  related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on
  water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically
  unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water
  quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies
  that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water
  quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual
  water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality
  monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country.
  The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified
  as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number
  of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. </p>
