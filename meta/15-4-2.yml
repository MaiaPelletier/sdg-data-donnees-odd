SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial
  ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
  land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 15.4: By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems,
  including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits
  that are essential for sustainable development</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 15.4.2: Mountain Green Cover Index</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is designed to measure the
  extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs,
  trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. &#x2013; in order to monitor progress towards
  the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total
  surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year.
  The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess
  the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.</p>
