SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global

SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 17.1: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including
  through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity
  for tax and other revenue collection</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 17.1.1: Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP,
  by source</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: '<p>Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of GFSM 2014 an
  increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for
  assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units have
  four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social
  contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14).
  Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most
  general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts
  receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are
  actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision
  for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government
  units from other resident or non-resident government units or international organizations,
  and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other
  revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants.
  Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services;
  (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and
  (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee
  schemes.</p>'
