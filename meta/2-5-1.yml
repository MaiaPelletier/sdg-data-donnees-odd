SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated
  plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including
  through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional
  and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of
  benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional
  knowledge, as internationally agreed</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 2.5.1: Number of plant and animal genetic resources for
  food and agriculture secured in either medium or long-term conservation facilities</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food
  and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (<em>ex situ</em>,
  in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources
  worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used
  in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.</p>
