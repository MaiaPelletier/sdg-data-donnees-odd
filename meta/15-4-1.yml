STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The indicator Coverage by protected areas of important sites for
  mountain biodiversity shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important
  site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the
  global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas
  and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).</p>
