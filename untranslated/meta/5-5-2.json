It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females in (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only the share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.</p>","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 5.5: Ensure women&apos;s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator: 5.5.2: Proportion of women in managerial positions</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-01","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-01: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/sdg-data-donnees-odd/commit/fab6a6cf10387e65cc6047529440d9353c0f6b33","indicator":"5.5.2","target_id":"5.5","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-05-02"}
